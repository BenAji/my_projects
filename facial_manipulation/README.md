# Facial Expression Manipulation

To manipulate facial expressions, I needed to detect a face and its features and then alter these features to change the expression. While it can be a complex task, I can guide you through a basic example using OpenCV and Dlib in Python.

## Installation

First, I had to install OpenCV and Dlib using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install dlib
```
Dlib includes a pre-trained facial landmark detector that I used to find facial features. I also downloaded the pre-trained model for detecting facial landmarks. One commonly used model is the "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat," which I downloaded from the Dlib model repository.

### Step-by-Step Guide
Here's a step-by-step guide I followed to perform basic facial expression manipulation:

- Detect Faces: I used OpenCV to detect faces in an image.

- Detect Facial Landmarks: I used Dlib's pre-trained model to detect facial landmarks.

- Manipulate Facial Features: I applied transformations to the facial features to change the expression.
